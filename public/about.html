<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Ello, the name's Butcher. I'm just getting stuck into this whole web development thing. Bit new to it, but I'm picking up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—having a crack at small projects, learning the ropes as I go.</p>
<p>The web development’s a wild place and I plan on mastering it.</p>
<p>if you're curious or just wanna have a chat, you can hit me up right <a href="./contact.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers for stopping by!</p>
